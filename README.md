# Deepware : deep learning-based autonomous driving toolkit

Deepware is the Deep Learning-based Autonomous Driving Toolkit, mainly focuses on end-to-end and mid-to-mid driving. Deepware is used ROS/ROS2, Tensorflow, Autoware, Docker and CARLA/LGSVL. Deepware is provided automatic data collector, data extractor, data augmenter, model trainer and driving agents.
